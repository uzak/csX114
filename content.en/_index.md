# CS1114 and CS2114


Hello and welcome to the DevOps specialization for the Viennese Full-Stack course!

The goal of this entire curricula is to make you DevOps Junior in only 12 weeks. This means that you must love challenges! Because this is not a lot of time and we have a lot of ground to cover. 

This documentation is meant as an addon for the [Journey DevOps Curriculum](https://journey.study/v2/learn/courses/252/modules/18402/units/0). It will link the relevant projects from the curriculum and besides that provide further information and projects to make this ambicious goal possible.
