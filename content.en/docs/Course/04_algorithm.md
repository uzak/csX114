## What Is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions designed to
perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. It is the
foundation of all computer programs and is used to process data, make
decisions, or automate repetitive tasks.

## Daily Life Examples of Algorithm

Making a Cup of Tea:

```
Step 1: Fill the kettle with water.
Step 2: Boil the water.
Step 3: Place a tea bag in a cup.
Step 4: Pour boiling water into the cup.
Step 5: Add sugar/milk if desired.
Step 6: Stir and serve.
```

Finding a Word in a Dictionary:

```
Step 1: Open the dictionary.
Step 2: Locate the section based on the first letter of the word.
Step 3: Narrow down based on the second and subsequent letters.
Step 4: Find the word and read its definition.
```

Crossing the Street:

```
Step 1: Look left.
Step 2: Look right.
Step 3: Look left again.
Step 4: If the road is clear, cross; otherwise, wait.
```

## Key Features of an Algorithm:

* Input: The algorithm accepts zero or more inputs to work with.
* Output: The algorithm produces one (or multiple) result or outcome.
* Definiteness: Each step must be clearly defined without ambiguity.
* Finiteness: The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
* Effectiveness: Each step of the algorithm can be performed in a finite amount of time using available resources.

KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)

## What Is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is a simplified, informal way of writing algorithms that
uses plain language and basic programming constructs without worrying
about syntax. It bridges the gap between human thinking and actual code.
Example of Pseudocode:

```
Task: Find the largest number in a list.
Input: list of numbers

1. Initialize a variable Max to the first element of the list.
2. For each element in the list:
    a. If the element is greater than Max:
        i. Set Max to this element.
3. Output: Max.
```

## Advantages of Using Pseudocode

* Language-Independent: It's not tied to a specific programming language.
* Focus on Logic: Allows the designer to focus on the algorithm's structure without worrying about syntax.
* Easy to Understand: Non-programmers can follow and provide feedback.

## MSI

* **M**anually. Always solve the problem manually first (ideally on paper).
* **S**tep-by-Step. Then design the algorithm. What are the steps that need to be taken?
* **I**mpelement. Proceed to implement the algorithm in a programming language.

## Homework (graded)

Given a string. Return two numbers (tuple), the first will represent the number of spaces in the string, the other of non-spaces. Your task is pass the M. and S. steps on paper and only then to implement the algorithm in Python. Both the paper and the script are required.
