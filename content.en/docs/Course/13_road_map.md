# Road Map

Python is great for prototyping. Maybe it won't make for the most efficient application, but you'll be able to create it in no time (RAD). That said, Python is very good to test out concepts.

To improving your core programming skills (in Python):

* practice: codewars and the like
* learn advanced Python: OOP, decorators, generators, context managers
* clean code

Some of the useful modules you'd better know about:
* venv
* decimal
* json
* itertools
* pytest
* sphinx (for documentation)
* re
* sys
* os
* shutil
* argparse
