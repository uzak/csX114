### conditionals

(+/-/*/division), operand2 and will read the values, convert them to
numbers and print the result

### loops

Create a Number Guessing Game in Python. Write a Python program that
allows a user to guess a secret number between 1 and 10. The program
should guide the user by providing feedback on whether their guess is
too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses
 the correct number.
