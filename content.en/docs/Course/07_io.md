# Input/Output

Communication with the user and the environment.

## String Interpolation
String interpolation is inserting variables or expressions into strings.  Python offers several ways to achieve this:
* **f-strings** (from Python 3.6): f"Hello, {name}".
* **str.format()**: "Hello, {}".format(name).
* **% strings**: "Hello, %s" % name

We focus here only on the first method. Examples:

```
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# Using f-strings
greeting = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."
print(greeting)

# Evaluating expressions in f-strings
calculation = f"2 + 2 = {2 + 2}"
print(calculation)

```

## String Formatting

Formatting strings allows control over how data appears.
Use placeholders for alignment, padding, or precision:

* `{}`: Default placeholder.
* `{:.2f}`: Floating-point with 2 decimal places.
* `{:<10}`: Left-align in 10-character width.

Example:

```
# Numeric formatting
price = 19.99
formatted_price = f"Price: ${price:.2f}"  # Two decimal places
print(formatted_price)

# Alignment
data = "Python"
print(f"'{data:<10}'")  # Left-align
print(f"'{data:>10}'")  # Right-align
print(f"'{data:^10}'")  # Center-align
```
## Console
You can interact with the user via the console (in text based UIs):

```
# Printing output
print("Welcome to the console class!")

# Getting user input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Advanced stuff:

```
# Print without a newline
print("Loading", end="")
for _ in range(3):
    print(".", end="")
print(" Done!")

# Formatting console output
value = 42
print(f"The answer is: {value:010}")  # Padded with zeroes
```

## Files

Files allow reading and writing persistent data (on storage).  Python uses the open() function with modes:

* `'r'`: Read.
* `'w'`: Write (overwrites existing content).
* `'a'`: Append.

Boy scout rule - always leave the place in the same or better state as you encountered it. Thus always close the files after you finished working with them. If you use the `with` keyword to work with them, Python will do that for you automatically, even if an exception occurs while working with it.

Examples:

```
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, file!")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("File content:", content)

# Appending to a file
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis is appended text.")

# Reading line by line
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())
```

## Command Line Arguments (`sys.argv`)
The `sys.argv` list allows you to access command-line arguments passed to a Python script.

`sys.argv[0]` is the name of the script, and subsequent elements are the arguments.

Example:

```
import sys

# Example: Accessing command-line arguments
if len(sys.argv) > 1:
    print("Arguments passed:", sys.argv[1:])
else:
    print("No arguments passed.")

# Example: Simple command-line calculator
if len(sys.argv) == 4:
    num1 = float(sys.argv[1])
    operator = sys.argv[2]
    num2 = float(sys.argv[3])

    if operator == '+':
        print(f"Result: {num1 + num2}")
    elif operator == '-':
        print(f"Result: {num1 - num2}")
    elif operator == '*':
        print(f"Result: {num1 * num2}")
    elif operator == '/':
        print(f"Result: {num1 / num2}")
    else:
        print("Unsupported operator!")
else:
    print("Usage: python script.py <num1> <operator> <num2>")
```

## Homework (graded)

### 1
Create a formatted report with the names and scores of students using string formatting.

### 2

Write a script to:
    * Ask the user for their name and age.
    * Save this data to a file.
    * Read and display the content of the file.
